    Common PDB Commands:
    ---------------------------------
    l (list)
    n (next line)
    p (print)
    c (continue - finishes debugging)
    q (quit - but in a bad ugly way, better to just use c)

    BEWARE OF 1-LETTER VARIABLE GOTCHA!
    -----------------------------------
    Don't name variables with one letter when using PDB,
    if you do, the commands above could conflict with the 
    variables and the commands will win.
